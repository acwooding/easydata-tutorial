Welcome to the easydata-tutorial repo! If you're attending the Pydata Global Tutorial, "Love your (data science) Neighbour: Reproducible Data Science the Easydata Way", you're in the right place!

You're about to embark on an Easydata Quest for reproducibility. In preparation, you'll need to get your tools ready. In particular, you will need to have the following basic requirements installed on your machine:
* Make
* conda >= 4.8 (via Anaconda or Miniconda)
* Git

## TODO Add platform specific linked instructions here

When you think you're ready, run:
```
python quest/am_i_ready.py
```



ABOUT EASYDATA
--------------
This git repository is build from the [Easydata](https://github.com/hackalog/easydata) framework, which aims to make
your data science workflow reproducible. The Easydata framework includes:

* tools for managing conda environments in a consistent and reproducible way,
* built-in dataset management (including tracking of metadata such as LICENSES and READMEs),
* a prescribed project directory structure,
* workflows and conventions for contributing notebooks and other code.

EASYDATA REQUIREMENTS
------------
* Make
* conda >= 4.8 (via Anaconda or Miniconda)
* Git

For more on getting start with Easydata see [Getting Started](reference/easydata/getting-started.md)


Project Organization
------------
* `LICENSE`
* `Makefile`
    * Top-level makefile. Type `make` for a list of valid commands.
* `Makefile.include`
    * Global includes for makefile routines. Included by `Makefile`.
* `Makefile.env`
    * Command for maintaining reproducible conda environment. Included by `Makefile`.
* `README.md`
    * this file
* `catalog`
  * Data catalog. This is where config information such as data sources
    and data transformations are saved.
  * `catalog/config.ini`
     * Local Data Store. This configuration file is for local data only, and is never checked into the repo.
* `data`
    * Data directory. Often symlinked to a filesystem with lots of space.
    * `data/raw`
        * Raw (immutable) hash-verified downloads.
    * `data/interim`
        * Extracted and interim data representations.
    * `data/interim/cache`
        * Dataset cache
    * `data/processed`
        * The final, canonical data sets ready for analysis.
* `docs`
    * Sphinx-format documentation files for this project.
    * `docs/Makefile`: Makefile for generating HTML/Latex/other formats from Sphinx-format documentation.
* `notebooks`
    *  Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is a number (for ordering),
    the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description,
    e.g. `1.0-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.
* `quest`
    * This is where you'll find materials related to the Easydata Quest for Reproducibility.
    * `quest_codewords.md`: **QUEST TASK** This is the only file you'll need to worry yourself for now. In fact, go on, take a look at it. It will help you along on your quest.
* `reference`
    * Data dictionaries, documentation, manuals, scripts, papers, or other explanatory materials.
    * `reference/easydata`: Easydata framework and workflow documentation.
    * `reference/templates`: Templates and code snippets for Jupyter
    * `reference/dataset`: resources related to datasets; e.g. dataset creation notebooks and scripts
* `reports`
    * Generated analysis as HTML, PDF, LaTeX, etc.
    * `reports/figures`
        * Generated graphics and figures to be used in reporting.
* `environment.yml`
    * The user-readable YAML file for reproducing the conda/pip environment.
* `environment.(platform).lock.yml`
    * resolved versions, result of processing `environment.yml`
* `setup.py`
    * Turns contents of `src` into a
    pip-installable python module  (`pip install -e .`) so it can be
    imported in python code.
* `src`
    * Source code for use in this project.
    * `src/__init__.py`
        * Makes `src` a Python module.
    * `src/data`
        * Scripts to fetch or generate data.
    * `src/analysis`
        * Scripts to turn datasets into output products.
