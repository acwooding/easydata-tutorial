In particular, we don't specify how you should do your work in the brainstorming phase (other than recommending that you check-in your work via git whenever something seems to work).\n",
    "\n",
    "We love test-driven development, but we're agnostic about it's use with your data science workflow. This isn't software engineering, this is data science. However, once you hit the editing phase of your work, once you start to put together something beyond a scattered Sucky First Draft (SFD), it's time to start wearing that SEng hat. And if you care about sharing with your data science neighbours and friends, testing is paramount. \n",

    "    * **Test running clean notebooks**: We can't say this enough. Always test a clean run of a notebook before checking it in! `Kernel -> Restart & Run All` for the win. Most if not all `MISSING-STATE` and `VARIABLE-SCARCITY` issues would be resolved by this simple workflow step. Automate this to make it even easier. Running analysis steps can be slow. Make the slow ones manual tests, and the quick ones, like this notebook, run in CI. \n",
    "    * **Test run from a fresh environment**: Blow it away. Start from scratch. See if you have any unaccounted for `MISSING-STATE` hiding in your environment.\n",
    "    * **BONUS-Test on another architecture**: This is where CI is your friend. It's usually easy to run on at least one platform that's different from your own.\n",
    "* **Keep track of your random seeds**: Many algorithms aren't deterministic. Keep track of your random seeds whenever possible so you can control as much randomness as you can. \n",
    "* **Save a copy of your output (images)**: While eyeball tests aren't ideal as the only check, it's sometimes the only way to check if you've controlled for randomness and successfully reproduced a results. Save your output images. Many a time have we found architecture differences from pictures! Check-in your `Kernel -> Restart & Run All` Notebooks (`nbdiff` is your friend here!)"
