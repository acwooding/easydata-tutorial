# Setting up and Maintaining your Conda Environment (Reproducibly)

The `easydata-tutorial` repo is set up with template code to make managing your conda environments easy and reproducible. Not only will _future you_ appreciate this, but so will anyone else who needs to work with your code after today.

If you haven't yet, configure your conda environment.

## Configuring your python environment
Easydata uses conda to manage python packages installed by both conda **and pip**.

### Adjust your `.condarc`
**WARNING FOR EXISTING CONDA USERS**: If you have `conda-forge` listed as a channel in your `.condarc` (or any other channels other than `default`), **remove them**. These channels should be specified in `environment.yml` instead.

We also recommend [setting your channel priority to 'strict'](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html) to reduce package incompatibility problems. This will be the default in conda 5.0, but in order to assure reproducibility, we need to use this behavior now.

```
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```
Whenever possible, re-order your channels so that `default` is first.

```
conda config --prepend channels defaults
```

**Note for Jupyterhub Users**: You will need to store your conda environment in your **home directory** so that they wil be persisted across JupyterHub sessions.
```
conda config --prepend envs_dirs ~/.conda/envs   # Store environments in local dir for JupyterHub
```

### Fix the CONDA_EXE path
* Make note of the path to your conda binary:
```
   $ which conda
   ~/miniconda3/bin/conda
```
* ensure your `CONDA_EXE` environment variable is set correctly in `Makefile.include`
```
    export CONDA_EXE=~/miniconda3/bin/conda
```
### Create the conda environment
* Create and switch to the virtual environment:
```
cd easydata-tutorial
make create_environment
conda activate easydata-tutorial
make update_environment
```
**Note**: When creating the environment the first time, you really do need to run **both** `make create_environment` and `make update_environment` for the `src` module to install correctly.

To activate the environment, simply `conda activate easydata-tutorial`

To deactivate it and return to your base environment, use `conda deactivate`

## Maintaining your Python environment

### Updating your conda and pip environments
The `make` commands, `make create_environment` and `make update_environment` are wrappers that allow you to easily manage your conda and pip environments using the `environment.yml` file.

(If you ever forget which `make` command to run, you can run `make` by itself and it will provide a list of commands that are available.)


When adding packages to your python environment, **do not `pip install` or `conda install` directly**. Always edit `environment.yml` and `make update_environment` instead.

Your `environment.yml` file will look something like this:
```
name: easydata-tutorial
  - pip
  - pip:
    - -e .  # conda >= 4.4 only
    - python-dotenv>=0.5.1
    - nbval
    - nbdime
    - umap-learn
    - gdown
  - setuptools
  - wheel
  - git>=2.5  # for git worktree template updating
  - sphinx
  - bokeh
  - click
  - colorcet
  - coverage
  - coveralls
  - datashader
  - holoviews
  - matplotlib
  - jupyter
...
```
To add any package available from conda, add it to the end of the list. If you have a PYPI dependency that's not avaible via conda, add it to the list of pip installable dependencies under `  - pip:`.

You can include any github.com python-based project in the `pip` section via `git+https://github.com/<my_git_handle>/<package>`.

In particular, if you're working off of a fork or a work in progress branch of a repo in github.com (say, your personal version of <package>), you can change `git+https://github.com/<my_git_handle>/<package>` to

* `git+https://github.com/<my_git_handle>/<package>.git` to point to the main branch of your fork and
* `git+https://github.com/<my_git_handle>/<package>.git@<my branch>` to point to a specific branch.

Once you're done your edits, run `make update_environment` and voila, you're updated.

To share your updated environment, check in your `environment.yml` file. (More on this in [Sharing your Work](sharing-your-work.md))


#### Lock files
Now, we'll admit that this workflow isn't perfectly reproducible in the sense that conda still has to resolve versions from the `environment.yml`. To make it more reproducible, running either `make create_environment` or `make update_environment` will generate an `environment.{$ARCH}.lock.yml` (e.g. `environment.i386.lock.yml`). This file keeps a record of the exact environment that is currently installed in your conda environment `easydata-tutorial`. If you ever need to reproduce an environment exactly, you can install from the `.lock.yml` file. (Note: These are architecture dependent).

#### Using your conda environment in a jupyter notebook
If you make a new notebook, select the `easydata-tutorial` environment from within the notebook. If you are somehow in another kernel, select **Kernel -> Change kernel -> Python[conda env:easydata-tutorial]**. If you don't seem to have that option, make sure that you ran `jupyter notebooks` with the `easydata-tutorial` conda environment enabled, and that `which jupyter` points to the correct (`easydata-tutorial`) version of jupyter.

If you want your environment changes (or `src` module edits) to be immediately available in your running notebooks, make sure to run a notebook cell containing
```
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```

More on notebooks can be found in [Using Notebooks for Analysis](notebooks.md).

### Nuke it from orbit
Sometimes, you need to be sure. Making things reproducible means that blowing things away completely and rebuilding from scratch is always an option. To do so:
```
conda deactivate
make delete_environment
make create_environment
conda activate easydata-tutorial
touch environment.yml
make update_envrionment
```
and then proceed with managing your environment as above.
