NOTE: By default, raw data is installed and unpacked in the
`easydata-tutorial/data` directory. If you are working with big data (or
have a small disk partition), it is HIGHLY recommended that you point
this directory elsewhere; i.e. by setting paths['data_path']. For example:
>>> conda activate easydata-tutorial
>>> python -c "import src; src.paths['data_path'] = '/path/to/big/data'"

You have been warned.
