# Stage 2: Where do I go next?

Have you ever wondered:

* Where did I leave off?
* What needs to get done next?
* Where do I find that again?

If so, this stage of the Quest is for you.

## Reproducibility Issues
* (GIT-NIGHTMARE): A git snotball of a mess. Complicated merge conflicts. Mostly caused by underlying git workflow issues.
* (WHERE-WAS-THAT): Difficulty finding where you put that file or that work, `My-Notebook-Copy-4.ipynb` maybe? or was it `My-Notebook-Copy-2.ipynb`? `ouput.png`?
* (MY-DOG-ATE-MY-HOMEWORK): Anything not checked in to a repo. Your computer died and took everything with it.

## The Easydata Way
On most data science projects, we don't need all of software engineering, but some of it really comes in handy. Especially when it comes to saving things for future retrieval, and avoiding the awkward "my computer ate my homework" moments. Git+GitHub works great for this. So do default project organization schemes. And intentional default workflows.

### Default Better Principles
* **Use revision control**: Always save your work. This is the way to do it with code. Even better...
* **Use a collaborative git+GitHub workflow**: Tools like GitHub exist to make mutli-user git workflows not suck. In fact, with some basic conventions in place with your collaborators, it can make working together on code great.
* **Use a default project/repo organization**: Putting the same kinds of things in the same places accross all of your projects means that there's one less things to think about.
* **Name things to find them later**: It doesn't matter how good your work is, if it's impossible to read, no one can understand it. Use names that are both machine readable (no weird characters) and human understandable. Take an extra second to make the name of your files, functions and really anything you have to name be simple, short, intuitive. If you come looking for it later, and don't find it on your first guess, rename it. Now. Pro-tip: rename it what you looked for first!
